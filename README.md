## Installation

pip3 install required for:

    pyowm
    pypollen

Sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key, add to `clientsecrets.py` file in project root:

    owmkey = '<key here>'

Also using PyPollen from Benadryl (!), which builds on the Met. Office's pollen forecast with arm-waving something something. However, the API is drop-dead simple.
